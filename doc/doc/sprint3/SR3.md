Unfinished Task: All sprint 3 user stories and tasks have been completed, although new user stories have been added to the product backlog

Good practices: Each member complete an individual React component, this clearly allocates responsibilities and each component is on an individual branch, so it avoids conflict and prevents duplicate work.

New practices: Communicate more often if a member is stuck or having a hard time completing a task, this way we can help each other out more often and hopefully save time while getting more work done. Some components reply on others to function before they can be implemented, so some of us had to work more closely together compared to previous sprints.

Harmful practices that should be stopped: So far for sprint 3 we think we did a pretty decent job at avoiding bad practices, although this time around some user stories were much harder to implemented than previous sprints, and mid terms and mid term assignments also are all around this time, many of us probably couldn't work on the project as much as we could have.

Best experience: Getting the project started and seeing the work put into it all function as intended.

Worst experience: Some of us have never used the React framework or learned JavaScript, so it was difficult to get started and understand how the project works, but other members who have more experience were helpful enough to guide the ones who were struggling more. Implementing third party plugins such as Mailchimp also took time, as the person working on it had to learn how that functioned before being able to integrate it into the website.
