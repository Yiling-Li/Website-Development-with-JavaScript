## How Our MCSS Website Will Be Different

The MCSS Website will be the official place where students and school executives can find or contribute any and all information related to the UTM's Mathematical and Computational Sciences Society.

One major difference between our website compared to exisitng competitors is that we don't require the user to create a third party account in order to access these information; some may be unable to access Facebook/Twitter/Discord due to their country of residence or personal ideals.

Another feature that will be included is a Reseource Page where students can find help related to Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics.

Our website will also contain Mailchimp integration, which would greatly benefit the MCSS team to monitor and moderate the information and traffic of the website.

There will also be a section that allows the user to be directed to the MCSS Shopify website.


All features listed above are either not implemented by the competitors or are simply impossible to integrate into the platform they are built on. Currently the Facebook and Twitter pages are very underutilized by the MCSS, most likely because these platforms do not contain enough features that are needed. The Discord Server is relatively active, however, due to the nature of Discord, it is difficult for the MCSS to post anything other than announcements or news. This is where our website would come in to aid in the lack of resources; since it will be a standalone website, the MCSS will be able to do anything they wish on it without needing to worry about constraints laid by another company/platform.
