    - Release goals of sprint 1: Build a website to provide a platform for students to browse information about MCSS 

    - Release plan of sprint 1: We are planning to finish our 5 user stories which are established on Jira. The main idea of these 5 user stories is to build a simple website about MCSS related information, so that students can browse some basic information on this website. The most part of our work will focus on frontend of the website.

    - Potential sprint goals: If we have time, We will try to add some backend to the website so that all the related information can be stored in the database. And the excutive team of MCSS will be able to publish their post or information in the future sprint.

    - Completion date: Our expected completion date is Feb 12 to finish our 5 user stories.
