### How did we organize and what tools we used
We use Discord and Wechat for almost daily communication, whether to discuss our next steps or resolve any problems that we have come across. As of sprint0 we decided that we would split the workload for the project in a way so that each of us could work on what they are most familiar and profficient at, for example, some of us have taken CSC309 so have experience for developing the frontend and design of the website, while others find that they could focus on the backend and databases since they find those easier to work with.

### How did we make decisions
In order to produce the best product we could in the limited time we have in the course, we decided that the most efficient way to work is the divide up the features that we will implement, and then members would work on the features that they are the strongest at, this way we could save time and maybe even out perform our initial expected goal.

### How did we define priorities and how did we vote
We all agreed on that most important features that must be implemented first for the website to function, most of these were also defined by the MCSS, so we intend to accomplish all the necessary requirements as soon as possible as it is our top priority. Since the website and requirements were pretty clearly defined from the get-go, most of our votes  pretty much agree on what we should focus on.

### How frequently did we meet
Since some members joined later than others, we waited for the group to be settled before we discussed any furthur about the project. On average we meet around two to three times a week, although we don't know if this number will increase or decrease overtime, we think that it is a good frequency as of now (mainly due to different class times and half of our team being in a different time zone).

### What lessons should we take for the next phase
We think that the best thing to do is to set up a soft schedule as to when we would meet each week, this way we can be sure that at least most of us would be present when meetings do occur. We would also need to balance our workload from the course with other assignments and projects that we have, as most of us have quite busy schedules outside of CSC301.
